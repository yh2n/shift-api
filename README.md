# restaurant-schedule-app

## Synopsis

This is a project motivated by the constant need of the restaurant industry to monitor _**F**ront **O**f the **H**ouse_ scheduling via a simple tool.

## Motivation
This app is destined for professionals of the restaurant industry in need for a quick and straighforward way to manage 
scheduling updates for the FOH. Indeed a vast majority of bartenders, waiters, hosts are present part-time and pursue other artistic endeavors, 
another career or take classes. Many of them need some shifts covered –at times on a moment's notice– and this results in a constant exchange of emails/messages
between coworkers. <br>Managers expect a notification of those changes and some may require their approval for various reasons – busy shifts may not being assigned to 
new hires for instance. 

With this app, managers are able to enter all employees in their restaurant's database, edit and send the schedule. On the other hand, for any given shift
staff memebr can set their status to *need coverage* or *able to cover*. The app allows to connect easily people looking time off with people
looking for extra income...all without unnecessary emails, messages, phone calls.
